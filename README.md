# MultiThreadedServer

This Project was the first 2 week assessment during the Cook Systems FastTrack'D Intensive Java Programming course. I had 2 days to build this project with no help. When the project is run, (n) number of computers can connect to my mine and see files for download, as well as download the files. While people are downloading files from me, I can also be downloading files from others.
